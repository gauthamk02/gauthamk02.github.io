A collection of books that I've read and found interesting in no particular order along with a short summary and my thoughts on it. I will keep adding to the list as I read more books.

**Siddartha - Herman Hesse:**
<br>Follows the story of a child prodigy as he embarks on a travel seeking spirtuality and meaning. He goes on to become an ascetic, then a bussinessman indulging in all the pleasures and again begins to lead a saintly life on a river bank where he was able to find peace. A classical piece of literature that explores the concepts of eastern philosphy. 

**Animal Farm - George Orwell:**
<br>A satirical novel on a bunch of farm animals taking over the control of a farm in hope of creating an equal and just place but slowly spirals into a totalitarian system. Contains phrases like "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." that are occassionally used in discussions as a reference to class inequality. A good read exploring the ideas of revolutions, authoritarianism and crowd manipulation in a satirical way.

**Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari:**
<br>Explains many aspects for human development, evolution and formation of modern societies in an immersive way. An insightful book containing many thought provoking topics and a recommended read for interested people to get a general understanding of human history.
