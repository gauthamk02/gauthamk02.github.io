title: U-Net Water Body Segmentation

A project using the U-NET model for segmenting water bodies from satellite images. The model is deployed to Huggingface spaces using Gradio. This is one
of my first D projects and I learned a lot doing this project.

Anyway its not a big deal, I just uploaded this project as a blog to test the working of this Hugo theme and I routinely modify it just to get the GitHub
activity graph green. teehee.
