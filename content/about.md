Hello there, I see that you've come to the my website and is interested in knowing more "About Me". Well, I'm from Kerala, India and am currently an undergrad student studying Computer Science in Amrita University. I spend time with neural networks and PyTorch when working and linear algebra when studying. If im not doing these two, you'll find me at my room bending over any wierd fantasy/fiction book or at the beach looking at stray dogs (from a distance). Talk to me about Deep Learning, Tech Stuff, Movies, Books, Dogs, or anything that you find interesting. I'm always up for a good conversation.

I am also an active member of the student run FOSS club [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in) where I stay back after college to work on various exciting projects, particpate for hackathons and organise events. Being a part of this club has helped me get exposed to the open-source world and have allowed me to meet and interact with a lot of amazing people.

If you are interested in the work I do, check out my GitHub profile [https://github.com/gauthamk02](https://github.com/gauthamk02) or my [CV](/CV/Gautham_Krishnan_CV.pdf). You can reach out to me at [gauthamkrishnanpriya@gmail.com](mailto:gauthamkrishnanpriya@gmail.com). Also follow me on Twitter [@gauthamk02](https://twitter.com/gauthamk02) to read my random thougths and ideas.
