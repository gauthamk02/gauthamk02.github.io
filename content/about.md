Hello there, I see that you've come to the my website and is interested in knowing more "About Me". Well, I'm from Kerala, India and am currently a pre-final year undergrad student studying Computer Science in Amrita University. I spend time with neural networks and PyTorch when working and linear algebra when studying. If im not doing these two, you'll find me at my room bending over any wierd fantasy/fiction book or at the beach looking at stray dogs (from a distance). Talk to me about Deep Learning, Tech Stuff, Movies, Books, Dogs, or anything that you find interesting. I'm always up for a good conversation.

I am also an active member of the student run FOSS club [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in) where I stay back after college to work on various exciting projects, particpate for hackathons and organise events. Being a part of this club has helped me get exposed to the open-source world and have allowed me to meet and interact with a lot of amazing people.

If you are interested in the work I do, check out my GitHub profile [https://github.com/gauthamk02](https://github.com/gauthamk02) or my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1Tbe-himD18DG0xv2gzxOKHdKMI3H5-/view?usp=sharing). You can reach out to me at [gauthamkrishnanpriya@gmail.com](mailto:gauthamkrishnanpriya@gmail.com). Also follow me on Twitter [@gauthamk02](https://twitter.com/gauthamk02) to read my random thougths and rants.

## My Current Work

### 1. **Research Intern at TeXNano:**
I am part of the EUSML project that works on building AI-assissted tools for the Endoscopic Ultrasound(EUS) procedure. EUS is a complicated procedure that takes a lot of time to master and we collect annotated data of the procedure from experienced doctors and are building an AI model that can detect the stomach stations and more accurately in real-time during the procedure. As part of the project, I work on scripts for generating the dataset from raw data, training the models, maintaining the code-base and researching different methods for getting the best result.

### 2. **Research Team Member at Tech4Good Lab, UCSC**
I work on the ai-economist project that uses multi-agent reinforcement learning for modelling apprenticeship learning and the effects of subsidies and other government policies on it. We construct diferent scenarios of apprenticeship, mentoring, policies and simulate them using RL to find and interpret the results.

## Past Works

### 1. **ACM Internship**
I researched different methods of Sample Size Determination to predict the sample size required to train a Machine Learning model to achieve a certain accuracy and explored various algorithms and evaluated their effectiveness in different scenarios. As part of the research I also explored McNemarâ€™s and other statistical tests for determining the better-performing model.\
