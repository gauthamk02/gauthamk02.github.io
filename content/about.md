Hello there, I see that you've come to the my website and is interested in knowing more "About Me". Well, I'm from Kerala, India and am currently an undergrad student studying Computer Science in Amrita University. I spend time with neural networks and PyTorch when working and linear algebra when studying. If im not doing these two, you'll find me at my room bending over any wierd fantasy/fiction book or at the beach looking at stray dogs (from a distance). Talk to me about Deep Learning, Tech Stuff, Movies, Books, Dogs, or anything that you find interesting. I'm always up for a good conversation.

If you are interested in the work I do, check out my GitHub profile [https://github.com/gauthamk02](https://github.com/gauthamk02) or my [CV](/Gautham_Krishnan_CV.pdf). You can also reach out to me at [gauthamkrishnanpriya@gmail.com](mailto:gauthamkrishnanpriya@gmail.com).
