      <description>A collection of books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read and found interesting in no particular order along with a short summary and my thoughts on it. I will keep adding to the list as I read more books.
Guns, Germs and Steel - Jared Diamond (Currently Reading): Explores the reasons for domination of few cultures over others including resource availability, social organization and technological advancements. More detailed and descriptive than Sapiens. Will add more details once I finish reading it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since the Hackathon and I am finding the motivation to write about it now. I am not sure why it took me so long to write. Probably because I&amp;rsquo;m lazy and the current semester break has left me with some extra time in which I find myself doing the random small things that I have been putting off for a long time.
Anyway, coming to the Hackathon, it was Hackverse 4.</description>

      <description>Deep Learning and AI have gained a lot of popularity because of the recent advancements in the field showing their capabilities for tasks like image detection, chat completion, image generation etc. At the base of all these models is Artifical Neural Networks(ANN). This article provides a basic understanding of maths and theoretical working of these networks.
Most of the maths present in this article comes under Linear Algebra and Calculus. Anyone who has done an undergrad course or two on these topics will be familiar with the concepts explained in the article.</description>

      <description>Hello! The following is a short introduction thats meant to give a general info about me to the people that stumble on this site.
Hailing from Kerala, India, I&amp;rsquo;m currently a pre-final year undergrad student studying Computer Science in Amrita University. I spend time with neural networks and PyTorch when working and linear algebra when studying. This has allowed me to work on interesting research projects on the field of AI and contribute to many open-source projects.</description>

      <title>U-Net Water Body Segmentation</title>

      <description>A project using the U-NET model for segmenting water bodies from satellite images. The model is deployed to Huggingface spaces using Gradio. This is one of my first D projects and I learned a lot doing this project.
Anyway its not a big deal, I just uploaded this project as a blog to test the working of this Hugo theme and I routinely modify it just to get the GitHub activity graph green.</description>
