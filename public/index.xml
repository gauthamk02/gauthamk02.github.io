      <description>Hello there, I see that you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the my website and is interested in knowing more &amp;ldquo;About Me&amp;rdquo;. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m from Kerala, India and am currently an undergrad student studying Computer Science in Amrita University. I spend time with neural networks and PyTorch when working and linear algebra when studying. If im not doing these two, you&amp;rsquo;ll find me at my room bending over any wierd fantasy/fiction book or at the beach looking at stray dogs (from a distance).</description>

      <description>A project using the U-NET model for segmenting water bodies from satellite images. The model is deployed to Huggingface spaces using Gradio. This is one of my first D projects and I learned a lot doing this project.
Anyway its not a big deal, I just uploaded this project as a blog to test the working of this Hugo theme and I routinely modify it just to get the GitHub activity graph green.</description>
