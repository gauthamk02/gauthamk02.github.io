      <title>My University Years: An Amritapuri Chronicle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog captures my journey through four transformative years at Amrita University&amp;rsquo;s Amritapuri campus during my undergraduate studies. I write this both as a chronicle of the experiences that shaped me and as a tribute to my 18-year-old self who first stepped onto this campus, as well as to the remarkable individuals I&amp;rsquo;ve met along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I began writing these reflections during my final months at the university, looking back with the perspective that comes from maturity and distance. What you&amp;rsquo;ll read here represents the pivotal moments that significantly influenced my development, from a high school graduate with ambitious dreams to a more complete and self-aware individual ready to embark on the next chapter. With this blog, I intend to offer readers — both those who know me and new ones who discover it — insights into my personal journey throughout these formative college years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Winning My First Hackathon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since the Hackathon and I am finding the motivation to write about it now. I am not sure why it took me so long to write. Probably because I&amp;rsquo;m lazy and the current semester break has left me with some extra time in which I find myself doing the random small things that I have been putting off for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, coming to the Hackathon, it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hackverse 4.0&lt;/a&gt; conducted by NITK-Surathkal and Devfolio. As with most of the hackathons that I participated in, it began with RV(Rajagopalan) sending the link to the hackathon and asking if we should participate in it. This was at the beginning of our 4th Semester when we completed our GSoC proposal submission when we all were pretty free and were looking for something to do. So the next evening in the amFOSS lab, we asked everyone if they were interested in participating and started forming teams. Unlike the usual team size of up to 4 members for hackathons, Hackverse only allowed a team size of up to 3. Initially, 9 of us were interested in participating and formed 4 teams in which I, Aashray and Abhinav were together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intro to Maths of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://gauthamk02.github.io/posts/intro-to-maths-of-neural-networks/</link>

      <guid>https://gauthamk02.github.io/posts/intro-to-maths-of-neural-networks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning and AI have gained a lot of popularity because of the recent advancements in the field showing their capabilities for tasks like image detection, chat completion, image generation etc. At the base of all these models is Artifical Neural Networks(ANN). This article provides a basic understanding of maths and theoretical working of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the maths present in this article comes under Linear Algebra and Calculus. Anyone who has done an undergrad course or two on these topics will be familiar with the concepts explained in the article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>U-Net Water Body Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://gauthamk02.github.io/posts/unet-water-body-segmentation/</link>

      <guid>https://gauthamk02.github.io/posts/unet-water-body-segmentation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A project using the U-NET model for segmenting water bodies from satellite images. The model is deployed to Huggingface spaces using Gradio. This is one&#xA;of my first D projects and I learned a lot doing this project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway its not a big deal, I just uploaded this project as a blog to test the working of this Hugo theme and I routinely modify it just to get the GitHub&#xA;activity graph green. teehee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
